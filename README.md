## Predicting-Toxicity-in-Tweets-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
The objective of the project is to predict toxicity in tweets by cleaning and preprocessing the text data, converting it into numerical vectors using natural language processing techniques, and applying machine learning classification algorithms to accurately classify tweets as toxic or non-toxic. 

### Tools used
Pandas

Nltk

Sci-kit learn

Numpy

Matplotlib

Pickle

### Approach used
Cleaning the text data by tokenizing, stemming, lemmatization, removal of punctuations and stop words with the help of nltk.

Converting the text data into numerical vectors using Countvectorizer and Tfidf methods.

For each of these methods, applying ML classification algorithms such as RandomForest Classifier, SVC, DecisionTree Classifier, Naive Bayes model, KNN classifier and finding which model gives best accuracy. 

Training the model and getting accuracy score and other evaluation metrics for unseen data.

Checking the model's prediction capability by manually passing tweet input and getting predictions as Toxic or Non-toxic tweets and finally analysing which method best suits for this dataset.
